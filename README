I deleted the old Plotfiles, the new ones now use freetype2/OGLFT whereas before
they used freetype1/OGLFT.

Well that was all there was in the README for a while, but I recently changed
over to opensuse 12.2, and I found stuff rather difficult.

I needed the following stuff installed, along with the development files.
gltt, fontconfig, libqt4 (with qt3 support) lib Xft, SDL, freeglut, and
all the freetype and truetype stuff (especially freetype2)

First, OGLFT is still required (version 0.9) you can install with rpm or tarfile. If you use a tar file, just configure --prefix=/usr, make, make install.

GLee is still required: get the tarball for version 3.10. Don't bother with
higher versions - oglft can't work with them. Again, use prefix=/usr.

Compilation, you need gnu make, the gcc 

Then, add the magic lines tou your .bashrc file


export PATH=$PATH:./
export CPATH=$CPATH:/usr/include/freetype2
export CPATH=$CPATH:/usr/lib64/qt4/include
export CPATH=$CPATH:/usr/lib64/qt4/include/Qt

Otherwise you get compile errors.

After that, download the bitmaps and XFiles from my github, and 
add them to /usr/local/include

Finally, download my fonts from my github and add them to /usr/share/fonts


and all was well

At least on opensuse.


If you manage to get things installed on MS windows, please send
